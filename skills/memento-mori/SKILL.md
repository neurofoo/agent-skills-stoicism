# Memento Mori (Reflection on Mortality)

## Overview

*Memento mori* is Latin for "remember that you must die." In Stoic practice, regularly contemplating death is a powerful tool for **clarity and focus**. Far from being depressing, it's meant to *liberate* us from trivial anxieties and encourage a life of virtue and presence.

The Stoics, from Epictetus to Marcus Aurelius, all advised reflecting on mortality. By keeping the inevitability of death in mind, we put our values and worries in proper perspective. Marcus Aurelius wrote: *"You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think."*

This skill helps **overcome the fear of death**: when we face that fear regularly in thought, it becomes less paralyzing. We learn to see death as a natural part of life's cycle.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when the user:
- Is procrastinating or wasting time on unimportant things
- Dwells on grudges, vanity, or trivial matters
- Feels anxiety about death or losing loved ones
- Needs help setting priorities or making important decisions
- Has experienced someone's death or a close call and wants to process it

## Interactive Guide

When guiding a user through this exercise:

### Step 1: Contemplate Your Own End
Guide them to bring mortality to mind calmly.

**Prompt:** "In this quiet moment, bring to mind the fact that you are mortal. One day, inevitably, you will die - it could be far in the future or sooner than expected. Notice any discomfort, and try to meet it with calm acceptance: this is the common fate of all humans, and thus natural. How does it feel to sit with this truth?"

### Step 2: Imagine Today Was Your Last
Use Marcus Aurelius's prompt for clarity.

**Prompt:** "Marcus Aurelius wrote: 'You could leave life right now; let that determine what you do and say and think.' If this day were your last, how would you want to conduct yourself? What would you drop? What would you prioritize? Would you be arguing about minutiae, or reaching out to loved ones?"

### Step 3: Recall Others' Mortality
Extend the reflection to cultivate compassion.

**Prompt:** "Consider that everyone around you - family, friends, even annoying coworkers - will also pass away. How does this change your feelings toward them? If someone has angered you, consider that soon enough, both of you will be gone. Does this help dissolve the grudge?"

### Step 4: Find Meaning in Mortality
Help them see death as empowering.

**Prompt:** "Death is what gives life its urgency and meaning. Because time is limited, ask yourself: 'Am I living the way I want? What would I regret if I died today?' Use those answers constructively - what would you change? What matters most?"

### Step 5: Meditate on Nature's Cycle
Guide reflection on death as transformation.

**Prompt:** "All things in nature are cycles - day and night, seasons, generations. Our lives are a chapter in a much larger story. Marcus wrote that what dies returns to the whole, making room for new life. Can you view death as transformation rather than annihilation? How does this perspective bring peace?"

## Conceptual Reference

When explaining this concept:

**Core Teaching:** Regular reflection on death brings clarity. Petty problems lose their grip when we realize life is too short to spend in anger or anxiety over trifles.

**Key Insight:** Death is not a morbid topic but a clarifying lens. It helps us prioritize virtue and love every day, so that whenever our final moment comes, we can exit without regret.

**Practical Wisdom:** Use the "deathbed test" for decisions: "On my deathbed, what will I be glad I did?" This cuts through confusion about what truly matters.

**Quote:** "You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think." - Marcus Aurelius

**Liberation:** When we acknowledge mortality, we become more present and appreciative. The taste of food, the laughter of a friend, the routine of a normal day - all gain a precious glow.

## Outcome

Practicing *memento mori* instills a sense of **urgency to live well** and reduces fear. Users become more present and appreciative. Death ceases to be a taboo topic and becomes a fact of life they can face with dignity. Ultimately, this skill guides users to prioritize virtue and love every day, so that whenever their final moment comes, they can exit life without regret, having truly lived.
