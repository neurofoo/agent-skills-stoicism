# Dichotomy of Control

## Overview

The Dichotomy of Control is the foundational Stoic principle taught by Epictetus: some things are **up to us** (our own thoughts, choices, and actions) and other things are **not up to us** (external events, others' opinions, outcomes). By keeping this dichotomy in mind, we prevent futile worry over what we can't influence and attain inner tranquility.

A Stoic sage focuses only on **their own will and behavior**, never blaming others or fate for what befalls them. This principle enables resilient **emotional regulation**: when applied, it frees us from excessive anger or sorrow about externals, since we realize those lie beyond our direct control.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when the user:
- Feels anxious about an outcome they cannot directly control (job results, someone's reaction)
- Is frustrated or upset by external events (traffic, weather, others' decisions)
- Feels overwhelmed by everything that "could" happen
- Experiences guilt or anger over a setback and needs to distinguish controllable from uncontrollable factors

## Interactive Guide

When guiding a user through this exercise, walk them through these steps:

### Step 1: Identify What They Control
Ask the user to list aspects of their situation that are *within their control* - typically their **own judgments, effort, and actions**.

**Prompt:** "Let's start by identifying what you actually control here. What are the things in this situation that depend entirely on your own choices, effort, or attitude?"

### Step 2: Identify What They Don't Control
Help them acknowledge factors *outside their control*, such as other people's choices, natural events, or past occurrences.

**Prompt:** "Now let's look at what's outside your control - things like others' decisions, events that already happened, or outcomes that depend on factors beyond you. What falls into this category?"

### Step 3: Release the Externals
Guide them to consciously **release mental attachment** to outcomes they cannot alter.

**Prompt:** "For those external things you listed - can you say to yourself: 'This is not up to me, so I will not let it disturb my peace'? What would it feel like to let go of trying to control those?"

### Step 4: Focus on Their Own Action
Direct their energy toward their sphere of influence.

**Prompt:** "Now, given what IS in your control, what's the most valuable action you could take? What virtue could you exercise here - patience, diligence, honesty?"

### Step 5: Create a Reminder
Help them develop a mental check-in habit.

**Prompt:** "When you feel disturbed about this again, try asking yourself: 'Is this under my control?' If not, remind yourself not to let it upset you. If yes, take appropriate action. Would you like to try that now with your current situation?"

## Conceptual Reference

When explaining this concept:

**Core Teaching:** Epictetus taught that the path to tranquility is accepting that we have no ownership over external matters. Trying to control them is futile and causes suffering.

**Key Insight:** The harm we feel from external events comes not from the events themselves, but from our judgment that we *should* be able to control them. When we release that expectation, we release the suffering.

**Practical Wisdom:** By focusing only on what we control (our responses, our character, our effort), we remain effective and avoid wasting emotional energy on the uncontrollable.

**Quote:** "Make the best use of what is in your power, and take the rest as it happens." - Epictetus

## Outcome

By consistently practicing the dichotomy of control, users cultivate **serenity and resilience**. They will no longer be "hindered" by external twists of fate because they internalize that these are beyond them. Instead of lamenting or blaming forces outside themselves, they focus on their own character and choices, leading to a profound sense of freedom and peace.
