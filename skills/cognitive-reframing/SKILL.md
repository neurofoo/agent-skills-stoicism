# Cognitive Reframing (Stoic Examination of Impressions)

## Overview

Stoic philosophy teaches that **"Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views they take of things."** It's not the raw event that upsets us, but the **opinion or story** we attach to it.

Cognitive reframing is the skill of actively analyzing and changing those opinions - a precursor to modern cognitive-behavioral techniques. The Stoics called initial perceptions *"impressions"* (phantasia) and urged us to test these impressions before accepting them, especially if they provoke a strong emotional reaction.

Through this skill, we **challenge our first interpretation** of a situation and seek a more objective or beneficial view. The facts haven't changed, but the emotional charge is greatly reduced by changing the narrative.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when the user:
- Feels angry or insulted by someone's actions or words
- Experiences anxiety or fear based on worst-case assumptions
- Feels sadness or disappointment with catastrophic thinking
- Interprets others' actions negatively (being cut off, ignored, etc.)
- Reports physical discomfort and catastrophizes about it

## Interactive Guide

When guiding a user through this exercise:

### Step 1: Catch the Emotional Trigger
Help them pause and notice the emotional alarm.

**Prompt:** "I notice you're experiencing a strong emotion. Let's pause here. Can you identify what you're feeling right now - anger, fear, shame, anxiety? This emotional signal tells us there's an impression in your mind worth examining."

### Step 2: Identify the Automatic Thought
Help them articulate their interpretation.

**Prompt:** "What are you telling yourself about this situation? What judgment did you make? Try to be specific. It might be something like 'They did that on purpose to disrespect me' or 'This outcome is a complete disaster' or 'I can't handle this.' What's the story running through your mind?"

### Step 3: Apply Reason - Test the Interpretation
Guide them to examine the thought critically.

**Prompt:** "Let's examine this thought like a philosopher. Is there evidence against your interpretation? Could there be other explanations? For instance, maybe they didn't see you, or are stressed, or there's no firm evidence of malice. Is your interpretation the *only* possibility, or even the most likely one?"

### Step 4: Reframe to a Stoic View
Help them construct a calmer, more rational framing.

**Prompt:** "Let's try some Stoic reframes:
- Is this within your control? If not, it's not inherently bad, only unpreferred.
- What IS under your control right now?
- What's a kinder or more objective explanation?
- How could you view this as an opportunity to practice a virtue?
- Will this matter in a year?

Which of these reframes resonates? Can you formulate a new thought that's both truthful and calming?"

### Step 5: Assent to the New Perspective
Guide them to accept the reframe.

**Prompt:** "Take a deep breath and let this new perspective replace the old one. Notice any change in your emotion - perhaps anger softening to mild annoyance, or anxiety becoming cautious awareness. You might reinforce it with: 'It seemed real, but it was just my interpretation.' How do you feel now?"

### Step 6: Respond Wisely
Help them act from the clearer headspace.

**Prompt:** "With this clearer head, how will you respond - or choose not to respond? Once your mind sees things correctly, virtuous action follows naturally. What's the wise response now that you're not reacting from that initial emotional charge?"

## Conceptual Reference

When explaining this concept:

**Core Teaching:** Epictetus said that it's not events that disturb us, but our judgments about them. We have the power to change those judgments.

**Key Insight:** Many insults or crises exist **only in our interpretation**, which we have the power to change. The "second hit" (the story we tell about events) often hurts more than the event itself.

**Practical Wisdom:** This is like being a detective about your own thoughts. Question the impression before accepting it. Often you'll find it was exaggerated or based on incomplete information.

**Quote:** "It is not things that disturb us, but our judgments about things." - Epictetus

**Sage Standard:** The Stoic sage "places blame neither on others nor on himself" - they simply work with reality as it is, viewing it in the light of reason.

## Outcome

Using cognitive reframing consistently leads to a steadier emotional life. Users realize many perceived insults or crises exist only in their interpretation. Over time, their default reactions shift - they become naturally more charitable in interpreting others and more grounded in interpreting events. Stress is reduced because they internalize that it's largely **our thoughts that stress us**. This skill gives users the Stoic superpower of *seeing things rightly*, which is the key to responding rightly.
